This repository contains the data from a research project.


The data.mat file contains the data needed to reproduce the experimental figures from the paper.
All units are in centimeters and seconds.

Here's a breakdown of the variables: 
- l_avg correspond to \ell 
- l_std correspond to the standard deviation of \ell 
- l_f correspond to \ell_f 
- V_t correspond to the theoretical velocity V 
- V_exp correspond to the experimental velocity V_{exp} 
\
V_t and V_exp are matrices where the rows represent the different drops in the frame and the columns represent time.
